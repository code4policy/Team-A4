  	<p class="sectiontitle" id="Future-Space-Industry"> The Future of the Space Industry </p>

	<p class="sectionsubtitle"> Though highly uncertain, huge room for growth </p>

	<p class="sectionintro"> Though it is hard to predict the future space industry since it all depends on technological breakthrough, there is significant room for growth in the space industry, supported by the rising demand for broadband and falling cost of access to space. If new industries such as space tourism and space freight transportation develop, the space industry will become even bigger. </p>
    	
	<p class="sectionintro">Morgan Stanley predicts that the industry will be going to 1.1 trillion dollars in 2040. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is more ambitious, projecting 1.4 trillion-dollar market size in 2030.</p>

	<p class="issuetitle" id="broadband">1. The demand of broadband will rise </p>

		<p class = "issueintro">The global internet penetration will rise as some regions that have not signed up for the internet well will start to use the internet. This trend will significantly increase the demand of broadband. Though the Internet use has matured in North America and Europe, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have a huge potential to increase the number of people using the Internet.</p>

		</script>


		<p class = "issuetext">There will be additional capacity need arising from the development of autonomous cars, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. In particular, commercialization of autonomous cars would require significant increase in bandwith since they are expected to generate extremely huge data. </p>

		<p class = "issueintro">Public spending on space will grow for national security reason. The magnitude would be modest compared with the private sector, constrained by the budget constraint. The prediction by Morgan Stanley shows that the United States would continue to be the largest contributor, while China would increase its presence.</p>

	<p class="issuetitle" id="cost-of-access">2. The cost of access to space will fall</p>

		<p class = "issueintro">The cost of satellite manufacturing and launching has fallen in the past decade due to the invention of very small satellites. This trend is expected to continue in the future due to the launcher companies’ development, pushed by fierce competition.　The graph below is the prediction by PwC showing that the launch of small satellites will rise in the next decades.</p>

		<div class="chart" id="pwc_satellite"></div>
		
		<p class = "issuetext">Reusable rocket that can land and relaunch, and modular launch system that can enable mass production of rocket are potential R&D areas to reduce the cost significantly. Also, The use of liquid oxygen and methane as propellants would contribute to simpler and lighter launcher and reusable-friendly engines and easier storage.</p>

	<p class="issuetitle" id="new-industries">3. New industries might emerge</p>

		<p class = "issueintro"> Space travel might become commercial in the near future. For example, KPMG predicts that suborbital space flights will be available by 2030. The market size depends heavily on whether the price will come down so that it is affordable to people beyond high-net worth individuals. </p>
		
		<p class = "issuetext"> Space rockets have a potential to deliver parcels much faster with lower cost than air freight. They cannot travel in a short distance, but they can be used for global cross-border parcel express. </p>
