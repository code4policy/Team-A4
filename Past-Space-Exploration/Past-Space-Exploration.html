		<p class="issuetitle" id="History-Human-spaceflights">1. History of Human space flights</p>
			
			<p class = "issueintro"> The history of human spaceflight dates back to 1961 and can be divided into three phases. The first was the launch competition phase between the two major nations in the 1960s. The second phase was the start of long-duration stays in space in the early 1970s, and the third and final phase was the comprehensive space development phase based on cooperation rather than competition.</p>

			<p class = "graphintro"> The space race played a decisive role in the cultural and technological competition between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. Space technology became the main battleground of competition and friction between the two countries because of its potential application to missiles and other military technologies, as well as its significant psychological benefits in terms of its impact on national pride, morale, and image to the rest of the world. In the early stages of the war, the Soviet Union dominated all the first achievements in the history of space exploration, but the United States succeeded in landing the most impressive man on the moon.</p>

      <p class="issuetitle" id="History-Artificial-Satelites">2. History of Artificial Satelites</p>
			
			<p class = "issueintro"> The first launch of artificial satellites was held by Soviet Union in 1957. Many countries have been actively participating in satellite development since the early stage of the project, since the cost burden of satellite development is lower than that of manned flight and its practical use is more valuable.</p>

			<p class = "issuetext"> The range of applications for satellites is very wide. In terms of disaster prevention and disaster monitoring, image data transmitted from satellites can be analyzed to detect signs of natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes. In the field of civil engineering and construction, it is useful to detect the occurrence and signs of landslides based on changes in elevation. The accumulated geographic information is also used for research in a wide range of fields such as agriculture and urban transportation. Furthermore, by detecting ocean color and sea surface temperature, it can also contribute to ensuring the safety of marine transportation. In addition, we should not forget the GPS function that has become a part of our daily lives. Satellites also perform a variety of other functions that are closely related to our daily lives.</p>
