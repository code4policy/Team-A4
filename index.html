    	<p class="sectionsubtitle"> How the private sector is rapidly taking over from public agencies </p>
    	<p class="sectionintro"> The space industry has historically been dominated by large public actors with massive budgets and very limited interest in financial pursuits in general, and profitability in particular. The massive decrease in costs of reaching space since the beginning of the 2000s has turned a trickle of space entrepreneurs into a flood, with dozens of startups competing for capital and ideas. This dynamic, however, does not mean that the State has been pushed away from the industry, as the private and public sector constantly rely on each other to provide the other with what it itself cannot provide: rapid operationalization for the private sector, and long-term, fundamental research on the public end. </p>
    	<p class="sectionsubtitle"> Main Section Issues </p>
    	<ol>
  			<li>More and More Startups...</li>
  			<li>... with More and More Capital!</li>
  			<li>A Lingering Reliance on Public Support</li>
		</ol>

		<!-- Issue 1 -->
		<p class="issuetitle">1. More and More Startups... </p>
			
			<p class = "issueintro"> In the 1990's, the space economy was largely dominated by universities and other academic institutions leveraging emerging technologies to create small sets of low-tech data sets largely for research purposes. The onset of the mid-2000's has enticed many companies to enter the competitive marketspace in search of unique products, mostly as either telecom providers, or as providers of unique data sets for other private users or large governmental institutions. </p>

			<p class = "issuetext"> The two largest private satellite operators, Planet and Spire, were both created in 2012 at a time when private capital was beginning to be deployed in abundance in the sector. This slow trickly has now grown into a massive industry spanning the entirety of the sector value chain, from component manufacturer to fully-fledged service operators.</p>
			
			<p class = "graphintro"> The graph below displays the number of space start-ups created since 2000. As can be seen, the growth of this number tracks fairly closely an exponential curve. </p>

					<img src="images/emerging_space_companies.png">

			<p class = "graphsubtext"> Emerging Space Companies Established Per Year [Northern Sky Research] </p>

			<p class = "issuetext"> As with other emerging sectors, most start-ups can expect to "fail quickly" as reaching profitabilty remains a tremendous endeavour for an industry that's on such a technological cutting-edge, but this difficulty does not seem, as yet, to discourage eager innovators. </p>

			<p class = "sectionoutro"> 
				<ul>
					<li> In 2017, the number of emerging space companies established reached 100, from only 2 in 2004. </li>
					<li> This growth is a testament to the attractivity of the sector for the private sector. </li>
					<li> It is expected that this rapid growth will continue reaching new heights in the forseeable future </li>
				</ul>
					</p>


		<!-- Issue 2 -->

		<p class="issuetitle">2. ... with More and More Capital!</p>
			
			<p class = "issueintro"> The growth in the raw number of start-ups created has been accompanied with a corresponding increase in the amount of capital flowing towards the industry. This trend has been nourished by both private investors (largely VCs) and public, or strategic investors, which have contributed to make this trend a critical industry enabler. </p>

			<p class = "issuetext"> Key growth factors for this trend have notably included the increasing awareness of large capital allocators in the potential of space, in its ability to generate planet-wide data and to rapidly transmit information in even the most isolated regions. This has led major banks (such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley) and leading Venture Capitalists (Sequoia Capital, KKR, etc.) into providing massive amount of capital to seed-stage or revenue-generating space companies.</p>
			
			<p class = "graphintro"> This graph provides information on the amount of capital invested in emerging space companies since 2000, and clearly displays the rapid rise in capital deployed since the early 2010's.</p>

					<img src="images/investment_space.png"> 

			<p class = "graphsubtext"> Investment in Emerging Space Companies (USD billions) [Northern Sky Research] </p>

			<p class = "issuetext"> This rapid growth has been sometimes referred to as a "bubble" due to its very rapid rise which owes indeed an important debt to the "cool factor" of the industry. It is also often said mentionned that very few space start-ups ever reach profitability due to the prohibitiveness of the CAPEX incurred in the technology phase. </p>

			<p class = "sectionoutro"> 
				<ul>
					<li> Since the early 2010's, capital allocated to the space industry has skyrocketed</li>
					<li> This is largely due to the improvement in the financial prospects of the companies</li>
					<li> Private and public investors are expected to keep investing in the coming years, though the rapid growth observed recently should reach a sustainable plateau shortly </li>
				</ul>
					</p>

		<!-- Issue 3 -->
		<p class="issuetitle">3. A Lingering Reliance on Public Support</p>

			<p class = "issueintro"> Despite the rapid growth in private capital deployed, the State remains an important partner for space companies as they remain important strategic interests for defense, weather monitoring, and other regalian activities which are at the core of the modern State's missioN. </p>

			<p class = "issuetext"> Start-Ups in the space industry still largely rely on public contracts to grow and "anchor" their products before they reach the maturity required for the private sector and can efficiently market their products. This has largely been accomplished through large procurement contracts, but also through the direct provision of capital as part of public investment campaigns. </p>

			<p class = "graphintro"> The following graph displays how public and private sector continue to support each other in providing emerging space actors with large amounts of capital for growth</p>

					<img src="images/publicfunding.png">

			<p class = "graphsubtext"> Cumulative and Annuel Private and Public Funding [Space Angels / JPL] </p>

			<p class = "issuetext"> This trend means that for the forseeable future, the private sector will continue to rely largely on the State to provide the early stage traction it requires before they can reach "commercial" profitability </p>

			<p class = "sectionoutro"> 
				<ul>
					<li> The State is still a key partner for space start-ups</li>
					<li> Large governmental contracts also bring the State massive advantages in performing key regalian missions, notably in security and national monitoring</li>
					<li> This trend should abate as the private companies are able to reach profitability faster as the technological costs of space continue decreasing </li>
				</ul>

    <!-- Future Section -->

  	<p class="sectiontitle"> Section ** - Future of Space Industry </p>
	<p class="sectionsubtitle"> Though highly uncertain, huge room for growth </p>
	<p class="sectionintro"> Though it is hard to predict the future space industry since it all depends on technological breakthrough, there is significant room for growth in the space industry, supported by the rising demand for broadband and falling cost of access to space. If new industries such as space tourism and space freight transportation develop, the space industry will become even bigger. </p>
    	
	<p class="sectionintro">Morgan Stanley predicts that the industry will be going to 1.1 trillion dollars in 2040. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is more ambitious, projecting 1.4 trillion-dollar market size in 2030.</p>
	<img src="images/ms_prediction.png" alt="Projection of Morgan Stanley">

	<p class="sectionsubtitle">Future Section Issues</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The demand of broadband will rise</li>
		<li>The cost of access to space will fall</li>
		<li>New industries might emerge</li>
		</ol>

	<p class="issuetitle">1. The demand of broadband will rise </p>
		<p class = "issueintro">The global internet penetration will rise as some regions that have not signed up for the internet well will start to use the internet. This trend will significantly increase the demand of broadband.</p>
		<p class = "graphintro">Though the Internet use has matured in North America and Europe, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have a huge potential to increase the number of people using the Internet.</p>
		<img src="images/wdi_internet_penetration.png" alt="Data of World Development Indicator">
		<p class = "issuetext">There will be additional capacity need arising from the development of autonomous cars, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. In particular, commercialization of autonomous cars would require significant increase in bandwith since they are expected to generate extremely huge data. </p>
		<p class = "issueintro">Public spending on space will grow for national security reason. The magnitude would be modest compared with the private sector, constrained by the budget constraint. The prediction by Morgan Stanley shows that the United States would continue to be the largest contributor, while China would increase its presence.</p>
		<img src="images/ms_public_spending.png" alt="Projection of Public Spending by Morgan Stanley">

	<p class="issuetitle">2. The cost of access to space will fall</p>
		<p class = "issueintro">The cost of satellite manufacturing and launching has fallen in the past decade due to the invention of very small satellites. This trend is expected to continue in the future due to the launcher companies’ development, pushed by fierce competition.</p>
		<p class = "graphintro">The graph below is the prediction by PwC showing that the launch of small satellites will rise in the next decades.</p>
		<img src="images/pwc_small_launch.png" alt="Projecion of PwC">
		<p class = "issuetext">Reusable rocket that can land and relaunch, and modular launch system that can enable mass production of rocket are potential R&D areas to reduce the cost significantly. Also, The use of liquid oxygen and methane as propellants would contribute to simpler and lighter launcher and reusable-friendly engines and easier storage.</p>

	<p class="issuetitle"> 3. New industries might emerge</p>
		<p class = "issueintro"> Space travel might become commercial in the near future. For example, KPMG predicts that suborbital space flights will be available by 2030. The market size depends heavily on whether the price will come down so that it is affordable to people beyond high-net worth individuals. </p>
		<p class = "issuetext"> Space rockets have a potential to deliver parcels much faster with lower cost than air freight. They cannot travel in a short distance, but they can be used for global cross-border parcel express. </p>
