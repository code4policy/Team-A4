    	<p id="sectionintro"> Dear Policymakers, graduate students and venture capitalists - or may we say future space enthusiasts? </p>

      <p id="sectionintro"> We are a team of Harvard Kennedy graduate students that created this page as an introduction to the space industry as part of a group project for DPI-691: Programming and Data for Policymakers. We are not sponsored by an industry or public players.</p>

      <p id="sectionintro"> We hope that you are just as excited about the space industry as we are! Please browse our web-page for a general industry overview with different deep-dives - described just below! - according to your interests! </p>
      
      <p id="sectionintro">We hope you have fun exploring this exciting and growing industry and feel free to let us know if there is anything we could do to improve your user experience!</p>
      
      <p id="sectionintro">Best,</p>
      
      <p id="sectionintro">Your team of space enthusiasts</p>

    <p class="sectiontitle">Three sections, to fully walk you through what's going on</p> 

    <p class="issuetext"> We offer to take you through three main sections, each dealing with a key aspect of the new space race: </p>

      <ol>
        <li> The Private Sector Gold Rush: With the dramatic reduction in the costs of launching to space, the private sector has made massive technological and business inroads in bringing to market the innovations that space makes available to mankind. How is it going? You'll find the answers in there! </li>
        <hr>
        <li> The Path of Space Exploration: Since Sputnik, mankind has made tremendous progress in populating Earth's orbits with a wide array of satellites, doing a number of things for us every day. Every nation is taking it at its own pace, with very different outcomes. You will be able to get a detailed picture here. </li>
        <hr>
        <li> The Future of the Space Industry: Many say that the space industry has reached a plateau, that innovation cannot go on forever, and that we will soon be hitting diminishing returns as to what space can deliver concretely for us on Earth. Is this true? You will be walked through this in this section! </li>
      </ol>
