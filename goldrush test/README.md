This is a multiple line graph demonstrating the display of seperate colour coded y axes for each line. This was written using d3.js v4 and is a follow on to the multiple line graph example [here](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/4db972df5d7efc7d611255d1cc6f3c4f). 

This graph is part of the code samples for the update to the book [D3 Tips and Tricks](https://leanpub.com/d3-t-and-t-v4) to version 4 of d3.js.
